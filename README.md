Course contained ten 90-minute classes with mixed theory and practice. No homework.   

## Course Description

The Internet was arguably the most impactful invention after electricity. All modern technology we interact with daily would be impossible without the internet. It would be considered magical if we were not so used to it. But what is the Internet really? And how does it work?  

In this course, we will build an understanding of how components of the modern web work and interact with each other. We will learn the basics of communications between computers, common languages for building web pages (HTML/JS/CSS), interaction protocols used for communication between existing web services, and ways to host your own service written in NodeJS on the web.

After this course, you will be able to build your own website or a web service to interact with the big world through internet.

Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of at least one programming language. Variables, loops, conditionals, file read-write operations.
